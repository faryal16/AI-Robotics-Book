## Response snapshot

Created a specification for the Isaac AI Brain module focusing on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation. The specification includes user scenarios for path planning simulation, synthetic data generation for perception models, and VSLAM implementation. It defines functional requirements and success criteria for educational and development purposes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for Isaac AI Brain module with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- 🧪 Tests:
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in specs/1-isaac-ai-brain/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created educational-focused specification for robotics AI module
