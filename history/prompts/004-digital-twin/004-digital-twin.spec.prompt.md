## Response snapshot

Created a specification for the Digital Twin module focusing on physics simulation in Gazebo, high-fidelity rendering in Unity, and sensor simulation. The specification includes user scenarios for physics simulation, rendering, sensor simulation, and reinforcement learning for robot arm control. It defines functional requirements and success criteria for educational and development purposes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for Digital Twin module with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- 🧪 Tests:
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in specs/2-digital-twin/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created educational-focused specification for digital twin robotics module
