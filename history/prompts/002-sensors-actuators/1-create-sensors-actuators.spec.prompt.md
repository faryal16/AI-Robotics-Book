## Response snapshot

Successfully created specification for "Module 2: Sensors & Actuators" with comprehensive user scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria, and key entities. The spec addresses the needs of university students, AI/robotics learners, and developers transitioning from software AI to physical AI. Created user stories for sensor understanding and data reading (P1), actuator control with AI decisions (P2), and ROS 2 sensor drivers integration (P3). All requirements are testable with measurable success criteria focused on perception and action systems. Quality validation checklist confirms specification completeness and readiness for planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for sensors & actuators educational module
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for specification creation
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification properly addresses sensor-actuator integration with AI decision making

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning phase for the module content
