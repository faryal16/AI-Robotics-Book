## Response snapshot

Created a specification for the Vision-Language-Action module focusing on voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper, cognitive planning with LLMs for ROS 2 action sequences, and a capstone project with autonomous humanoid tasks. The specification includes user scenarios for voice processing, cognitive planning, vision-based manipulation, and the integrated capstone project. It defines functional requirements and success criteria for educational and development purposes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for Vision-Language-Action module with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- 🧪 Tests:
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in specs/3-vision-language-action/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created educational-focused specification for vision-language-action robotics module
