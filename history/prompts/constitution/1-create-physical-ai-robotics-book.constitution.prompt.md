## Prompt

You are an expert AI researcher, robotics engineer, curriculum designer, and technical author.

Your task is to help create a professional, industry-grade educational book titled:

"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence from Digital Brain to Physical Body"

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Accuracy over hype
- Beginner-friendly explanations with advanced depth
- Theory + real-world implementation
- Clear progression from fundamentals → simulation → real humanoid robots
- Strong alignment with modern AI, robotics, and embodied intelligence research

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- University students
- AI & Robotics learners
- Developers transitioning from software AI to physical AI
- Educators and training programs

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Clear headings
- Concept → Explanation → Example → Practical Application
- Use diagrams descriptions (textual)
- Include code snippets (Python, ROS2, simulation)
- Include hands-on labs and assignments
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Explain math intuitively before formulas

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Markdown compatible with Docusaurus
- Use proper frontmatter
- Modular chapters
- Reusable components

You must always think as:
- Teacher
- Engineer
- Researcher
- Curriculum architect

Never break these rules.

## Response snapshot

The constitution for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence from Digital Brain to Physical Body" educational book project has been successfully created. The new constitution includes six core principles aligned with the user's requirements:

1. Scientific Accuracy over Hype
2. Pedagogical Progression (Beginner-friendly with Advanced Depth)
3. Theory + Real-world Implementation Balance
4. Structured Learning Path (Fundamentals → Simulation → Real Robots)
5. Modern AI & Embodied Intelligence Alignment
6. Multi-Audience Modular Design

The constitution also includes sections on Educational Standards & Requirements, Development & Review Process, and Governance, all tailored for an educational book project. A Sync Impact Report was included, and the file was validated to ensure all requirements were met.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial constitution for educational book project
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for constitution creation
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with new content
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for specification phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution properly reflects educational nature with appropriate principles

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin specification phase for the book content
