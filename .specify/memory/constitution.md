# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence from Digital Brain to Physical Body Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Scientific Accuracy over Hype
All content must be grounded in peer-reviewed research and scientifically validated approaches; avoid marketing language or unsubstantiated claims; prioritize evidence-based explanations over sensationalized descriptions.

### II. Pedagogical Progression (Beginner-friendly with Advanced Depth)
Content must follow clear learning progression from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations; each concept should be explained with intuitive explanations before formal definitions; provide multiple entry points for different skill levels.

### III. Theory + Real-world Implementation Balance
Every theoretical concept must be paired with practical implementation examples; include both mathematical foundations and hands-on code/application examples; ensure readers can both understand and apply the concepts.

### IV. Structured Learning Path (Fundamentals → Simulation → Real Robots)
Content must follow a clear progression: foundational concepts first, then simulation environments, finally real-world humanoid robot applications; each section builds upon previous knowledge in a logical sequence.

### V. Modern AI & Embodied Intelligence Alignment
All content must reflect current state-of-the-art in AI, robotics, and embodied intelligence research; include recent developments and emerging trends in the field; align with contemporary best practices in machine learning and robotics.

### VI. Multi-Audience Modular Design
Content must be modular and reusable across different audiences (university students, AI & Robotics learners, developers transitioning from software AI to physical AI, and educators); use Docusaurus-compatible markdown with proper frontmatter; ensure chapters can be used independently while maintaining coherence in sequence.

## Educational Standards & Requirements

All content must be beginner-friendly yet maintain advanced depth suitable for university students, AI & Robotics learners, developers transitioning from software AI to physical AI, and educators. Content must include clear headings, follow Concept → Explanation → Example → Practical Application structure, use textual diagram descriptions, include Python/ROS2/simulation code snippets, provide hands-on labs and assignments, avoid unnecessary jargon, and explain mathematical concepts intuitively before presenting formulas.

## Development & Review Process

All content must be developed with clear progression from fundamentals to simulation to real humanoid robots. Each chapter must include hands-on labs and assignments. Content must be written in Markdown compatible with Docusaurus, use proper frontmatter, be modular and reusable. All materials must be reviewed by subject matter experts in AI, robotics, and education to ensure accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation and review processes for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" educational material. All contributions must comply with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit justification and approval from the core editorial team. All content must be validated for accuracy, pedagogical effectiveness, and alignment with modern research standards.
