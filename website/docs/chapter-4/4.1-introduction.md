# Chapter 4: Sensing and Perception

## Concept
Sensing and perception systems form the sensory foundation of humanoid robots, enabling them to understand, interpret, and interact intelligently with their environment. These systems serve as the artificial equivalent of human sensory modalities, providing critical information about the robot's internal state and external environment necessary for safe navigation, intelligent decision-making, and natural human-robot interaction.

Unlike traditional robots operating in structured environments, humanoid robots must perceive and interpret the unstructured, dynamic, and complex environments designed for human use. This requires sophisticated multi-modal sensing capabilities that can detect, recognize, and track objects, people, and environmental features while simultaneously monitoring the robot's own state and ensuring safe interaction with humans and the environment.
