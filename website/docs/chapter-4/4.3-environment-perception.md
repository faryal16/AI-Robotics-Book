# Chapter 4: Environment Perception

## Concept
Environment perception is the sophisticated process of transforming raw sensory data into meaningful, actionable understanding of the robot's surroundings, enabling intelligent navigation, interaction, and decision-making. This process involves multiple levels of interpretation, from low-level feature extraction to high-level scene understanding, ultimately creating a coherent model of the environment that supports the robot's cognitive and control systems.

Unlike simple object detection, environment perception encompasses understanding spatial relationships, predicting future states, recognizing patterns of human behavior, and interpreting the semantic meaning of environmental elements. For humanoid robots operating in human environments, perception must achieve human-like understanding of complex, dynamic, and socially meaningful scenes while maintaining the real-time performance required for safe interaction.
