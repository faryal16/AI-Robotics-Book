# Chapter 3: Control Systems for Humanoid Robots

## Concept
Control systems represent the central nervous system of humanoid robots, orchestrating the complex interplay between perception, decision-making, and physical action to achieve stable, coordinated, and purposeful behavior. Unlike traditional robotic systems that operate in controlled environments, humanoid robots must navigate the dynamic complexity of human environments while maintaining stability, safety, and natural interaction patterns.

The control of humanoid robots presents unique challenges due to their high degrees of freedom, underactuated nature during locomotion, real-time constraints, and the need for safe human interaction.
