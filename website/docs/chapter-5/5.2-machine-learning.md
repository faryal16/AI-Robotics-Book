# Chapter 5: Machine Learning in Humanoid Robotics

## Concept
Machine learning represents a fundamental paradigm shift in humanoid robotics, enabling robots to improve their performance, adapt to new situations, and acquire new capabilities through experience and data. Unlike traditional rule-based systems that rely on pre-programmed behaviors, machine learning allows humanoid robots to automatically discover patterns, optimize their behavior, and generalize from experience to handle novel situations. This capability is essential for robots operating in complex, dynamic, and human-centered environments where pre-programming for every possible scenario is impossible.

The application of machine learning in humanoid robotics encompasses multiple domains including perception, control, manipulation, locomotion, and human-robot interaction. Each domain presents unique challenges and opportunities for learning, requiring specialized algorithms and approaches that can handle the real-time, safety-critical, and multi-modal nature of robotic systems.
