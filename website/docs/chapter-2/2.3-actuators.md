# Chapter 2: Actuators in Humanoid Systems

## Concept
Actuators are the artificial muscles of humanoid robots, converting electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic energy into mechanical motion that enables the robot to move, manipulate objects, and interact with its environment. In humanoid robotics, actuators must replicate the functionality of human muscles while operating within the constraints of artificial materials and control systems. The selection, design, and implementation of actuator systems is critical to achieving human-like movement, strength, and interaction capabilities.

Human muscles exhibit remarkable properties including variable stiffness, compliance, energy efficiency, and the ability to produce smooth, coordinated movements. Humanoid actuators must approximate these characteristics while providing the reliability, precision, and controllability required for safe operation in human environments.
